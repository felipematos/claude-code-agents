# UI Testing Workflow Template

## Overview
This document defines the UI testing workflow for the project, including test design, execution, and reporting processes.

## Test Environment
- **Environment**: Staging
- **Base URL**: [Set from .env.staging]
- **Browser**: Chrome (latest stable)
- **Automation Tool**: Puppeteer/Playwright

## Test Categories

### By Priority
- **Critical**: Must pass before any deployment
- **High**: Should pass for stable releases
- **Medium**: Important for quality assurance
- **Low**: Nice to have, run during full test cycles

### By Type
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing features still work
- **Feature Tests**: Validate new feature implementations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user journey validation

## Test Design Process

1. **Story Analysis**: Review user story and acceptance criteria
2. **Test Planning**: Identify test scenarios and edge cases
3. **Workflow Design**: Create step-by-step test procedures
4. **Environment Setup**: Define preconditions and test data
5. **Validation Points**: Specify assertions and expected results

## Test Execution Modes

### Quick Run
- Execute only Critical priority tests
- Used for pre-deployment validation
- Target completion: < 10 minutes

### Standard Run
- Execute Critical + High priority tests
- Used for regular CI/CD pipeline
- Target completion: < 30 minutes

### Full Run
- Execute all tests regardless of priority
- Used for comprehensive quality validation
- Target completion: < 2 hours

### Single Test
- Execute specific test workflow
- Used for debugging and development
- Target completion: < 5 minutes

```json
{
  "user_story_id": "US-YYYY-MM-DD-###",
  "criticality": "Critical|High|Medium|Low",
  "environment": "staging",
  "test_name": "Descriptive test name",
  "description": "What this test validates",
  "preconditions": [
    "List of setup requirements"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "action": "navigate|click|fill|select|upload|wait|assert|scroll|hover",
      "target": "CSS selector or URL",
      "value": "Input value if applicable",
      "description": "Human-readable step description",
      "expected_result": "What should happen"
    }
  ],

      "description": "Cleanup description"
    }
  ],
  "success_criteria": [
    "List of overall success conditions"
  ]
}
```

## Test Execution Logging

### Log Structure
- **Test Execution ID**: Unique identifier
- **Execution Metadata**: Timestamp, environment, browser info
- **Step Results**: Individual step outcomes with timing
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failures and key steps
- **Performance Metrics**: Page load times, interaction delays
- **Failure Details**: Error messages, stack traces, reproduction steps

### Log Storage
- **Location**: `.plan/ui_test_logs/`
- **Format**: JSON with embedded metadata
- **Screenshots**: Separate files referenced in logs
- **Retention**: Keep logs for last 30 days

## Failure Handling

### On Test Failure
1. **Capture Evidence**: Screenshot, error message, stack trace
2. **Log Details**: Record exact failure conditions
3. **Create Fix Task**: Generate urgent task for development team
4. **Block Deployment**: For Critical/High priority failures
5. **Notify Stakeholders**: Alert relevant team members

### Fix Task Creation
- **Priority**: Urgent for Critical/High test failures
- **Details**: Include failure evidence and reproduction steps
- **Assignment**: Route to appropriate development agent
- **Tracking**: Link back to original user story

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Deployment
- All Critical tests must pass
- No High priority test failures
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security scan completed

### Release Validation
- Full test suite execution
- Regression test verification
- User acceptance criteria validation
- Documentation updates completed

## Continuous Improvement

### Test Maintenance
- Regular review of test effectiveness
- Update tests for UI changes
- Remove obsolete test cases
- Optimize test execution time

### Metrics Tracking
- Test execution time trends
- Failure rate analysis
- Coverage assessment
- User story validation completeness

## Integration Points

### With Development
- Test design during story creation
- Test execution after code implementation
- Failure feedback loop for fixes

### With Deployment
- Pre-deployment validation gates
- Post-deployment smoke tests
- Rollback triggers on test failures

### With Product Management
- Test priority alignment with business value
- User story acceptance criteria validation
- Feature quality reporting

## Tools and Technologies

### Browser Automation
- **Primary**: Puppeteer for Chrome automation
- **Alternative**: Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **Headless Mode**: Default for CI/CD execution
- **Debug Mode**: Visual browser for development

### Test Data Management
- **Staging Data**: Dedicated test datasets
- **Data Cleanup**: Automated cleanup after tests
- **Data Privacy**: No production data in tests

### Reporting
- **Real-time**: Live test execution status
- **Summary Reports**: Test run summaries with metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical test performance data
- **Integration**: Results fed back to project management tools

**Note**: This workflow should be customized based on specific project requirements and technology stack.
