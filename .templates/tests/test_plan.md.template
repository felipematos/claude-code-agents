# Test Plan

_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD · Owner: Tester_

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the project, implementing a 4-tier testing approach aligned with the deployment pipeline.

---

## Testing Strategy Overview

Our testing approach follows a structured 4-tier model that provides quality gates at each stage of the development and deployment process:

**Unit Tests** → **Smoke Tests** → **Sanity Tests** → **Regression Tests**

### Testing Principles
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Catch issues early in the development cycle
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on business-critical functionality
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Prevent deployment of defective code
- **Continuous Feedback**: Rapid feedback to development teams

---

## Test Suite Hierarchy

### 1. Unit Tests (Per Task)
**Execution**: After each task implementation  
**Duration**: 1-3 minutes per task  
**Coverage**: Individual functions and components  
**Priority**: All code changes

**Purpose**:
- Validate individual code units
- Ensure TDD compliance
- Catch logic errors early
- Maintain code quality

**Test Files**:
- `tests/unit/test_*.py` (Python)
- `tests/unit/*.test.js` (JavaScript)
- Component-specific test files

### 2. Smoke Test Suite (Per Sprint)
**Execution**: After sprint completion  
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Coverage**: Core system functionality  
**Priority**: Critical tests only

**Purpose**:
- Validate basic system health
- Ensure core workflows function
- Quick deployment readiness check
- Sprint completion gate

**Test Plan**: `smoke_test_suite.md`

### 3. Sanity Test Suite (Pre-Staging)
**Execution**: Before staging deployment  
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes  
**Coverage**: Business-critical paths  
**Priority**: Critical + High priority tests

**Purpose**:
- Validate business-critical workflows
- Test integration points
- Security and performance checks
- Staging deployment gate

**Test Plan**: `sanity_test_suite.md`

### 4. Regression Test Suite (Pre-Production)
**Execution**: Before production deployment  
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes  
**Coverage**: Comprehensive system validation  
**Priority**: All test levels

**Purpose**:
- Comprehensive functionality validation
- Cross-browser and device testing
- Performance and security validation
- Production deployment gate

**Test Plan**: `regression_test_suite.md`

## Test Execution Matrix

| Test Level | Trigger | Duration | Priority | Pass Rate | Deployment Gate |
|------------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Unit | Task completion | 1-3 min | All | 100% | Task approval |
| Smoke | Sprint completion | 5-10 min | Critical | 100% | Staging ready |
| Sanity | Pre-staging | 15-20 min | Critical + High | 100% | Staging deploy |
| Regression | Pre-production | 30-60 min | All levels | 95%+ | Production deploy |

---

## Quality Gates

### Task Level (Unit Tests)
- All unit tests must pass
- Code coverage ≥ 80% for new code
- No critical code quality issues
- TDD compliance verified

### Sprint Level (Smoke Tests)
- All critical functionality working
- System health checks pass
- Basic user workflows functional
- No system crashes or errors

### Staging Level (Sanity Tests)
- Business-critical paths validated
- Integration points functional
- Security checks pass
- Performance within thresholds

### Production Level (Regression Tests)
- Comprehensive functionality verified
- Cross-platform compatibility confirmed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security posture validated

---

## Test Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Unit test execution
- Individual developer testing
- Fast feedback loops
- Mock external dependencies

### Staging Environment
- Smoke and sanity test execution
- Production-like configuration
- Real external integrations
- Performance testing

### Production Environment
- Regression test execution
- Final validation
- Monitoring and alerting
- Rollback capabilities

---

## Failure Response Protocols

### Unit Test Failures
- Block task completion
- Immediate developer notification
- Fix required before proceeding
- Re-run tests after fix

### Smoke Test Failures
- Block staging deployment
- Create urgent fix tasks
- Notify development team
- Sprint retrospective item

### Sanity Test Failures
- Block staging deployment
- Escalate to Product-Manager
- Risk assessment required
- Stakeholder notification

### Regression Test Failures
- Block production deployment
- Emergency response protocol
- Executive notification
- Go/no-go decision required

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Tracking
- Test execution times
- Pass/fail rates by category
- Defect escape rates
- Coverage trends
- Flaky test identification

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly test effectiveness review
- Monthly test strategy assessment
- Quarterly process optimization
- Annual strategy alignment

### Automation Enhancement
- Increase test automation coverage
- Optimize test execution speed
- Improve test reliability
- Enhance reporting capabilities
