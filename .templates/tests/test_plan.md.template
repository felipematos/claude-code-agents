# Test Plan

_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD · Owner: Tester_

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the project, implementing a 4-tier testing approach aligned with the deployment pipeline.

---

## Testing Strategy Overview

Our testing approach follows a structured 4-tier model that provides quality gates at each stage of the development and deployment process:

**Unit Tests** → **Smoke Tests** → **Sanity Tests** → **Regression Tests**

### Testing Principles
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Catch issues early in the development cycle
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on business-critical functionality
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Prevent deployment of defective code
- **Continuous Feedback**: Rapid feedback to development teams

---

## Test Suite Hierarchy

### 1. Unit Tests (Per Task)
**Execution**: After each task implementation  
**Duration**: 1-3 minutes per task  
**Coverage**: Individual functions and components  
**Priority**: All code changes

**Purpose**:
- Validate individual code units
- Ensure TDD compliance
- Catch logic errors early
- Maintain code quality

**Test Files**:
- `tests/unit/test_*.py` (Python)
- `tests/unit/*.test.js` (JavaScript)
- Component-specific test files

### 2. Smoke Test Suite (Per Sprint)
**Execution**: After sprint completion  
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Coverage**: Core system functionality  
**Priority**: Critical tests only

**Purpose**:
- Validate basic system health
- Ensure core workflows function
- Quick deployment readiness check
- Sprint completion gate

**Test Plan**: `smoke_test_suite.md`

### 3. Sanity Test Suite (Pre-Staging)
**Execution**: Before staging deployment  
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes  
**Coverage**: Business-critical paths  
**Priority**: Critical + High priority tests

**Purpose**:
- Validate business-critical workflows
- Test integration points
- Security and performance checks
- Staging deployment gate

**Test Plan**: `sanity_test_suite.md`

### 4. Regression Test Suite (Pre-Production)
**Execution**: Before production deployment  
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes  
**Coverage**: Comprehensive system validation  
**Priority**: All test levels

**Purpose**:
- Comprehensive functionality validation
- Cross-browser and device testing
- Performance and security validation
- Production deployment gate

**Test Plan**: `regression_test_suite.md`

  - Mobile responsiveness checks

### Tier 4: Regression Tests
- **Trigger**: Weekly scheduled runs (Sundays 2:00 AM)
- **Duration**: 2-4 hours
- **Coverage**: Full application testing
- **Priority**: All features, edge cases, performance
- **Last Run**: 2024-01-14 02:00:00
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED (156/158 tests)
- **Failed Tests**:
  - Performance test: Page load > 3s (TEST-142)
  - Cross-browser compatibility: IE11 layout (TEST-155)
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average response time: 245ms
  - Memory usage: 128MB peak
  - CPU utilization: 15% average
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Test Execution Matrix

| Test Level | Trigger | Duration | Priority | Pass Rate | Deployment Gate |
|------------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Unit | Task completion | 1-3 min | All | 100% | Task approval |
| Smoke | Sprint completion | 5-10 min | Critical | 100% | Staging ready |
| Sanity | Pre-staging | 15-20 min | Critical + High | 100% | Staging deploy |
| Regression | Pre-production | 30-60 min | All levels | 95%+ | Production deploy |
