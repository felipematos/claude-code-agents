## Execution Plan

### Pre-Execution Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Environment preparation
./scripts/prepare_test_environment.sh

# Database seeding
python manage.py seed_test_data --full

# Service health check
pytest tests/test_environment_readiness.py -v
```

### Phase 1: Critical Path Validation (15 minutes)
```bash
# Critical business workflows
pytest tests/ -m "regression and critical" --tb=short --maxfail=5

# Critical UI flows
npm run test:ui:critical

# Critical integrations
pytest tests/ -m "regression and critical and integration" --tb=short
```

### Phase 2: High Priority Features (15 minutes)
```bash
# High priority functionality
pytest tests/ -m "regression and high" --tb=short

# Cross-browser testing
npm run test:ui:cross-browser

# Performance benchmarks
pytest tests/ -m "regression and performance" --tb=short
```

### Phase 3: Medium Priority Coverage (15 minutes)
```bash
# Medium priority tests
pytest tests/ -m "regression and medium" --tb=short

# Feature completeness
pytest tests/ -m "regression and feature_complete" --tb=short

# Security validation
pytest tests/ -m "regression and security" --tb=short
```

### Phase 4: Low Priority & Edge Cases (10 minutes)
```bash
# Low priority tests
pytest tests/ -m "regression and low" --tb=short

# Edge cases and boundary testing
pytest tests/ -m "regression and edge_cases" --tb=short

# Cleanup and reporting
./scripts/generate_test_report.sh
```

## Success Criteria

### Deployment Gates
- **Critical Tests**: 100% pass rate (no exceptions)
- **High Priority Tests**: 100% pass rate (no exceptions)
- **Medium Priority Tests**: 95% pass rate (documented exceptions)
- **Low Priority Tests**: 90% pass rate (known issues acceptable)

### Quality Metrics
- Code coverage ≥ 80%
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security scan clean
- No memory leaks detected
- Database performance within limits

### Documentation Requirements
- All test failures documented
- Performance metrics recorded
- Security findings reported
- Known issues catalogued
- Risk assessment completed

## Failure Response Protocol

### Critical/High Priority Failures
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Stop deployment process
   - Create P0/P1 incident
   - Notify all stakeholders
   - Initiate emergency response

2. **Investigation Process**:
   - Isolate failure cause
   - Assess blast radius
   - Estimate fix timeline
   - Plan rollback if needed

3. **Resolution Tracking**:
   - Create fix tasks
   - Assign to appropriate team
   - Monitor progress
   - Re-run affected tests

### Medium/Low Priority Failures
1. **Assessment Phase**:
   - Evaluate business impact
   - Determine deployment risk
   - Consult with Product-Owner
   - Document decision rationale

2. **Risk Management**:
   - Create backlog items
   - Plan future fixes
   - Monitor in production
   - Prepare hotfix if needed
