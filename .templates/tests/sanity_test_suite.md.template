# Sanity Test Suite

_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD · Owner: Tester · Suite ID: SANITY-STAGING_

## Overview
Critical path validation before staging deployment. Focuses on business-critical flows and user journeys. Target execution time: 15-20 minutes.

## Execution Triggers
- Before staging deployment
- After major feature integration
- Before user acceptance testing
- After configuration changes

## Test Priority
**Critical + High** - Essential business functionality that cannot fail

**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Time**: 8 minutes

**End-to-End User Journeys**:
- Complete user registration and onboarding
- Primary business transaction flows
- Payment processing (if applicable)
- Data export/import functionality
- Admin panel critical operations

### 2. Integration Points
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

**External Dependencies**:
- Third-party API integrations
- Database transactions
- File upload/download systems
- Email/notification services
- Authentication providers

### 3. Security & Permissions
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 4 minutes

**Access Control**:

- Session security
- Input validation
- CSRF protection

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 3 minutes

**Performance Gates**:
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- API response times < 500ms
- Database query performance
- Memory usage within limits
- No memory leaks detected

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: System Readiness (2 minutes)
```bash
# Verify environment health
pytest tests/test_environment_health.py -v

# Check service dependencies
pytest tests/test_service_dependencies.py -v
```

### Phase 2: Critical Business Logic (8 minutes)
```bash
# Run business workflow tests
pytest tests/ -m "sanity and business_critical" --tb=short

# Execute UI critical paths
npm run test:ui:sanity
```

### Phase 3: Integration & Security (7 minutes)
```bash
# Test integrations
pytest tests/ -m "sanity and integration" --tb=short

# Security validation
pytest tests/ -m "sanity and security" --tb=short
```

### Phase 4: Performance Validation (3 minutes)
```bash
# Performance benchmarks
pytest tests/ -m "sanity and performance" --tb=short

# Load testing (light)
npm run test:performance:sanity
```

## Success Criteria

### Must Pass (Deployment Blockers)
- All Critical tests pass (100%)
- All High priority tests pass (100%)
- Performance benchmarks met
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- All integrations functional

### Quality Gates
- Total execution time under 20 minutes
- No test flakiness (consistent results)
- Code coverage maintained
- No new critical issues introduced

## Failure Response

### Critical Test Failures
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Block staging deployment
   - Create P0 fix tasks
   - Notify development team
   - Alert stakeholders

2. **Investigation Process**:
   - Capture failure evidence
   - Identify root cause
   - Estimate fix timeline
   - Communicate impact

### High Priority Test Failures
1. **Assessment Required**:
   - Evaluate business impact
   - Determine if deployment can proceed
   - Create fix tasks with appropriate priority
   - Document known issues

## Environment Configuration

### Staging Environment Requirements
- Production-like data volume
- All external services connected
- SSL certificates valid
- Monitoring systems active
- Backup systems functional

### Test Data Requirements
- Representative user accounts
- Sample business data
- Edge case scenarios
- Performance test datasets
- Security test vectors

---

## Reporting

### Test Results
- Detailed execution report
- Performance metrics
- Security scan results
- Coverage analysis
- Trend comparison

### Stakeholder Communication
- Pass/fail status to Product-Manager
- Performance metrics to DevOps
- Security findings to Security team
- Business impact to Product-Owner
